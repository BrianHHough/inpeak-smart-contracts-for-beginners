## In this Session:
We all have heard the term "smart contract" thrown around in web3, from NFTs to tokens, but what really is a smart contract? What do they look like?

In this short, but practical session, Brian Hough, will guide you through the ins and outs of smart contracts and help you understand what is really going on behind the open-sourced curtain of the blockchain.
