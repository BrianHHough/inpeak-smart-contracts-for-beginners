# **InPeak: Smart Contracts for Beginners Workshop**
Presented by: Brian H. Hough

Date: Thursday, December 8, 2022

## **In this Session:**
We all have heard the term "smart contract" thrown around in web3, from NFTs to tokens, but what really is a smart contract? What do they look like?

In this short, but practical session, Brian Hough, will guide you through the ins and outs of smart contracts and help you understand what is really going on behind the open-sourced curtain of the blockchain. No technical or coding knowledge is required. We will analyze a few smart contracts and by the end of the session, you will know how to read, analyze, and go off to build your own smart contracts for your projects.
